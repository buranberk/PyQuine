# 🌀 PyQuine



**PyQuine** is a small yet fascinating project that transforms any Python file into a **quine**—a self-replicating program that outputs its own source code.

## 🚀 <span style="color:#32cd32;">Usage</span>

1. ✏️ **Paste your code** into the `quine_code.py` file, just under the `# paste here` comment.
2. 🛠️ **Run** `quinizer.py` to generate the quine.
3. ✅ *Optional:* Test whether the quine works by running `test_quine.py`.

## ⚠️ <span style="color:#cc1d1d;">WARNING</span>

**Quine code disables `stdout`,** so printing to the console won't work.

---

## 🛠️ <span style="color:#ff8c00;">TODO</span>

- [ ] ✨ **Create a script** to take a file path as an argument and generate a quine from that file.
- [ ] 🔧 **Enhance support** for special characters (currently supports `\t`, `\n`, `\r`, commas, and `\\`).
- [ ] 📏 **Reduce the size** of the generated quine code.
- [ ] 🎛️ **Make `stdout` customizable.**
